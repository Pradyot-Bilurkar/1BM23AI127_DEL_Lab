This code trains a small neural network to solve the XOR problem, achieving nearly 100% accuracy after 10,000 epochs. 
The error steadily decreases during training, as shown in the plotted loss curve. 
Final outputs closely match the expected XOR values, correctly predicting all inputs when rounded. 
The learned weights and biases reflect the networkâ€™s adaptation to the non-linear XOR pattern.
Overall, the network effectively models the XOR function despite its non-linearity.
