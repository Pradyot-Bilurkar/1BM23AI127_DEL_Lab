This code compares three robustness-enhancing techniques—adversarial training, Tangent Prop, and Tangent Distance classification—using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. 
It first loads and preprocesses the data, then builds a simple neural network with TensorFlow/Keras. 
The adversarial training section generates perturbed (adversarial) samples using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and retrains the model on both clean and adversarial data to improve robustness. 
The Tangent Prop section adds a custom layer that injects small random perturbations during training to encourage local invariance and smoother decision boundaries. 
The Tangent Distance classifier, implemented separately using NumPy, classifies each test image by finding the nearest training image in feature space based on Euclidean distance. 
Finally, the script plots training loss and accuracy for comparison and prints the final test accuracies for all three methods.
