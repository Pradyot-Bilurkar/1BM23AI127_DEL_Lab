The provided Python code uses TensorFlow and Keras to compare the performance of two neural network regularization techniques—Dropout and Gradient Clipping—on a synthetic binary classification dataset. 
A simple feedforward neural network is built in both cases. The dropout model includes Dropout layers with a rate of 0.2, while the gradient clipping model uses the Adam optimizer with clipnorm=1.0 to prevent exploding gradients.
Both models are trained for 50 epochs, and their training and validation accuracy are plotted.
From the plotted graph, we observe that the dropout model generalizes better—its validation accuracy steadily improves and reaches a higher level (~95%) compared to the gradient clipping model (~85%), which appears to overfit after a 
point (training accuracy increases while validation accuracy plateaus or slightly decreases). 
This indicates that Dropout was more effective in preventing overfitting for this dataset than gradient clipping alone.
